# odin-recipes

This is a basic recipe website for the Odin Project.
It will test my knowledge of HTML up to this point in the series of lessons.
The website will have a main index page withs ome links to recipes.
Although I can style via css, and tailwindcss, I will not be applying any to this in order to complete the task at hand.
